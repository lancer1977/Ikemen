# Spot-A-Bot Companion
*POC*
## Purpose
This is intended to act as a service that runs resident on the streamers system to help with communication with the server. Currently the only interactoin that used this functionality was the MilkDrop tool. It uses some sketchy tools so I don't really recommend using it at this point. Primarily a POC
